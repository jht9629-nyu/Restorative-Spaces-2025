# Restorative-Spaces-2025

Taking time to unwind is restorative and essential given the nature of our lives and the media-rich environments we inhabit. This is especially true for those attending interactive and digital media programs in NYC. There are many ways individuals and groups engage in restoration, from taking walks in parks to meditation or yoga. Recently, more **immersive environments have emerged that leverage sound and projection**. In this class, students will **explore new opportunities for developing restorative spaces, augmented with immersive technology**, and more.
